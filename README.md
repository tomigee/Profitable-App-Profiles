# Beyond Downloads: A Data-Driven Guide to Building Truly Engaging Apps
A data analysis project using Apple App Store and Google Play Store data to examine what attributes of an app make it popular. The goal is to provide recommendations to developers on what characteristics to build into their next app to ensure its success.

The steps used in this analysis project are as follows:
1. ### Data cleaning: ###
    - Remove inaccurate data (based on discussions about the dataset on the internet)
    - Remove duplicate entries in the data
    - Removing data that's irrelevant to the scope of the project
2. ### Analysis: ###
    - Market competition analysis (App popularity by genre)
    - Popularity by size of user base
  
  
Purely based on popularity by genre and the size of the user base, I'd recommend that developers build social networking characteristics into their next apps, to maximize chances of success.
